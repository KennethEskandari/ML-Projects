# ML-Projects
A pack of 5 more ML Projects.
üîπ Machine Learning Project Pack (Beginner + Real AI Concepts)
Before you build AI, understand the process:

üß† Real AI engineering = Programming + Math + Data + Tools

Here‚Äôs a progression from "no-code" to "code-your-own".

1. Iris Flower Classifier (Classic ML Problem)
What You Build: A model that can classify flowers into 3 species based on petal/sepal sizes.

Skills Learned:

Supervised Learning

Training/Test Splits

Using scikit-learn

Concepts Covered:

Classification

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

2. Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer
What You Build: A model that tells whether a review is positive or negative.

Skills Learned:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words)

TF-IDF Vectorization

Concepts Covered:

NLP basics

Binary classification

Logistic regression / Naive Bayes

3. Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST Dataset)
What You Build: An image classifier for digits (0-9) using pixel data.

Skills Learned:

Working with image datasets

Neural networks using Keras
